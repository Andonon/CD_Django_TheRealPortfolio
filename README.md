The Real Portfolio
Make a portfolio page with links between routes.

This might look like a lot but focus on what you have to do.

Make 4 templates

Create links to 3 different routes. Links will look like they did with Flask.

Have a url pattern for each route.

Render a different template from each route.

Breaking big problems into smaller pieces is how every engineer starts to untangle a complex (or even simple) problem.
